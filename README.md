# idle-heroes-planners

The project currently consists of a [single spreadsheet to help plan for the Chinese New Years Event](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tGefNOMylSiG3aHTMzQ3PQeKajaeVPmn4Mhm92pjn8U/edit#gid=806550080). Follow that link and copy the spreadsheet to begin your planning. Instructions are embedded in the spreadsheet.
